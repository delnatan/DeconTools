# TODO

- implement Ikoma et al. ADMM decon
- implement PSF averaging for phase retrieval (simplex algorithm to align)
- implement phase retrieval (ER method or Gerchberg-Saxton)
- implement SCAD prior/penalty operators (smoothly-clipped absolute deviation)


Notes:

The self-adjoint, D^t * D, of a Fourier cropping operator D, is a unit rectangle where its value is 1 within the cropping range and 0 otherwise. The adjoint operator is a zero-padding in Fourier-space.
